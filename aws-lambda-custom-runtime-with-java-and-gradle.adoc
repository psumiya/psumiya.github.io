== Introduction

I came across this article about building a custom runtime earlier this year and promptly bookmarked it as something to try later when I get a chance.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/build-a-custom-java-runtime-for-aws-lambda/

Well, the end of year break in the work routine enabled me to wander along in various experiments, one of which led me back to this article.

The referenced article sets up a customized Corretto JDK 18 runtime for a Java lambda, using maven, and CDK to deploy.

This blog takes that article out for a spin and shares the same tricks, but with the following differences.

- JDK 19 instead of 18
- Gradle instead of Maven
- SAM/CloudFormation instead of CDK
- Incremental approach of starting with a vanilla JDK and then customizing it

== Story

This is the project if you want to view the final state of the code and configuration.

https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api

While that project is aimed at a different purpose, this blog is focused on how I evolved the project in the context of lambda's runtime over the last two days.

Java 11 -> Java 11 Custom Runtime -> Java 19 Custom Runtime

=== Part I
I started with a basic Java project with Gradle.

The empty project can be seen at this commit here: https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api/commit/a0f83aa377b14f1f46bc3f68847858f049f50d63[a0f83aa]

I then added the Lambda dependencies and a corresponding Lambda handler method.

See commit here: https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api/commit/07bea69fefb3ed9d6e480c0f9b448ad5047a483c[07bea69]

=== Part II
At first, there was JDK 11.

I decided to start with JDK 11 since that is one of the default supported runtimes by AWS Lambda.

It helped me get the quirks out of the way before I started experimenting more.

One of the quirks I ran into was that I was using IntelliJ to boostrap the project and my IntelliJ JDK is set to JDK 19 by default.

However, since I wanted to use JDK 11, I moved over to my non-IntelliJ terminal to build the project using Java 11 without affecting my IntelliJ setup.

I used sdkman to switch to Java 11, and ran gradle build.

TIP: Highly recommend sdkman if you need to work with multiple Java runtimes on your machine. See here: https://sdkman.io/

The build failed, since I had forgotten that I had used text block in my Handler. However, Text blocks were introduced in Java 15, i.e., a few versions later. I fixed the string locally. Then proceeded to build the zip.

NOTE: JEP 378: Text Blocks: https://openjdk.org/jeps/378

This compiled, and I was able to deploy and test the Lambda successfully.

Checkpoint 1 complete. Commit here (missed committing the updated Handler file though): https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api/commit/3fc360adf897a55054540262ae90f5328cb57ae7[3fc360a]

=== Part III
The next step was to continue to use Java 11 but with a customized runtime.

This is where the reference project started to come in handy.

It describes the logical aspects of how to put together a custom (and enhanced) runtime, which distills down to the following:

. Build application jar
. Define the Java Runtime you want to use
. Prepare bootstrap
. Bundle the above artifacts together in a zip
. Deploy the Lambda

==== Build application jar
I removed the buildZip gradle task I had created for the previous deployment, and instead switched to gradle shadow jar plugin (https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/getting-started/#default-java-groovy-tasks).

The following additional gradle changes were needed to enable communication between the custom runtime and Lambda, before building the jar.

* A runtime dependency on `com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-runtime-interface-client:2.1.1`
* A Manifest file within the built jar declaring that the `Main-Class` is `com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.api.client.AWSLambda`

==== Define the Java Runtime you want to use
I copied the Dockerfile and build.sh files from the reference blog.

Then iterated over it to make it build successfully for Java 11 and Gradle.

NOTE: Amazon Corretto has some well-defined documents for how to consume their distributions on different platforms like Linux, Mac, etc. This was helpful when building the Dockerfile. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/

==== Prepare bootstrap file
To create a custom runtime, you need the custom runtime entry point, an executable file, named `bootstrap`

You can define the optimized instructions to run your jar using the runtime you prepared in this executable.

The following example shows the bootstrap file I used at this stage.

----
#!/bin/sh

$LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT/jre11-slim/bin/java \
 --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
 -XX:+TieredCompilation \
 -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 \
 -XX:+UseSerialGC \
 -jar json-path-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar "$_HANDLER"
----

==== Bundle the above artifacts together in a zip
This is defined in the Dockerfile.

==== Deploy the Lambda
At this point I updated the Lambda template to declare that this was a custom runtime, and deployed and tested the Lambda.

Checkpoint 2 complete. Commit here: https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api/commit/c8f75fdf1552d15adae6cc7df11119b893863c06[c8f75fd]

==== Arm64
During these experiments, I wanted to see if the custom runtime worked with the arm64 architecture.

I tried it at the first instance I got, that is, after I had successfully deployed the custom Java 11 runtime.

[source,yaml]
----
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'

      Architectures:

      Handler: com.sumiya.Handler::handleRequest
      Runtime: provided.al2

      MemorySize: 512
      Timeout: 10
      Policies:

----

The deployment succeeded but the Lambda invocation failed with following errors.

[source, json]
{
  "errorType": "Runtime.ExitError",
  "errorMessage": "RequestId: 737ffec8-925f-4a7e-85fe-a996ed880e70 Error: Runtime exited with error: exit status 126"
}

[source,bash]

I backed out of the change and continued with the rest of the changes.

=== Part IV
The next step was to set up Java 19 but with a customized runtime.

I dare say this was the easiest step since I only needed to change the JDK distro in Dockerfile.

However, just for fun, I reverted the Handler string to now again be a text block!

Deployed and tested the lambda successfully.

Checkpoint 3 complete. Commit here: https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api/commit/27dfd80bddb12b9ae7c1ef837148f651f34657a3[27dfd80]

== Summary
For each of the checkpoints, I had a commit, and the diffs on that may tell you a better story on how the changes progressed.

https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api/commits/main (see Commits on Dec 30, 2022)

I enjoyed running this series of experiments. There is some more areas to explore, for example, using a lambda layer for the custom runtime, why the arm64 deployment fails, comparing the performance of each of the different variations, but that is for some other time.

Hope you enjoyed reading this too!
